/* Two console.log() are in different places and every time I change one I need make sure  
    I update the other one this is the perfect use-case of function().  

    Because, A function() in javascript all it does take some type of logic so console.log('hi')
    too and it just puts that inside of a particular piece of code that you can run whenever you want
    and it always going to do the same thing every single time.
